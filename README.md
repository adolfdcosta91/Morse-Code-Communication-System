nRF24L01+ library is also needed


Morse Beeper
Overview
A beeper is a wireless communication device that receives and sends messages to others using its internal transceiver. In this project, we design and prototype a device that resembles a beeper and is able to store contacts, send, and receive morse code messages.

This project involves interfacing with an LCD screen, a radio module, the EEPROM, and a buzzer. We also design and implement an easy to navigate user interface in a constrained 16x2 screen while managing external interrupts and handling data storage.

In the end, all devices that follow this guideline should be able to communicate as described in this document.
