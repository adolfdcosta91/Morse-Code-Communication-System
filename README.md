# Morse Code Communication System
I Design a system that doesn't use any existing Arduino libraries. Everything was developed from scratch using lower-level coding. The system was integrated with LCD- Keypad Sheild, Buzzer, and NRF24L01 wireless transceiver. 

It contains two or more devices connected in full-duplex mode. Each device has a unique name and a unique contact number. These details are store in the contact menu. A morse message can be transmitted to any other device in the system whose details are stored in the contact menu. The data is transmitted and received over a wireless channel at 2.4Ghz.
